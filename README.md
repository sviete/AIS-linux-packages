This project contains scripts and patches to build packages for the Android terminal and Linux environment system used in the [AI-Speaker](https://www.ai-speaker.com) project.

**@termux is looking for help with fixing issues, adding new packages and maintaining
existing ones. It would be very helpful if you submit a pull request with bug fixes.**

Processing of new package requests is limited. Repository is already big and recently
we got the [new problems with hosting](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/6348).
Submit requests only for things that can be important for most users.

This project is a fork off the Termux master branch - [Termux master](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/tree/master) - the packages are build for for Android 7.0 or higher.

Termux is looking for help in order to [solve issues](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
**Please submit the bug fixes, version updates and new packages - all contributions which will help to improve Termux are welcome.**
